          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            '05 Hongkonger that is equally bad at everything <img id="aEmoji1" src="https://teinc3.github.io/assets/omega_chair.gif" alt="Omega_Wheelchair_Emoji">
            <br><br>
            Currently studying Applied AI at HKU but planning to emigrate, because STEM people have no future here.
            <br><br>
            Have an interest in most things but can't actually be competent in any of them  <img id="aEmoji2" src="https://teinc3.github.io/assets/pepe_sadge.png" alt="Pepe_sadge">
            <br>However, I do wish to create a startup. I have no idea what it will be about, maybe sth related to AI since it's pretty fire recently.
            <br> Creativity is the only path forward in a world where everything is automated anyways.
            <br><br>
            I have preferred pronouns (<abbr title="Did you just assume my gender???"><span id="aUnderlineTooltip1">hokzar/poorjar</span></abbr>),
            but you may call me a trashcan or anything you like, I don't really care.
            <br><br>
            Also, I hate nerds and I am not a nerd. People who think I am a nerd are the nerdiest of the nerds

          <h2>What I'm Doing</h2>
          <h4>Last Updated March 2, 2024</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><span id="aLargeText1">Reading <i>The Thomas Sowell Reader</i></span> <br>
              Very based work in my opinion, when you realize that most of the "problems" in society are artificial constructs distracting you from the truthful reality.
              <br> Will probably look into more of his works in the future
              <br><br>
              Future books I plan to read:
              <ul>
                <li>Rich Dad Poor Dad</li>
                <li>In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span id="aLargeText2">Working as a pseudo web-developer</span><br>
              I'm not really a web developer and honestly full-time developers suck, I'd rather make a startup - they say "Go big or go home".<br><br>
              I learnt JavaScript from deobfuscating <a href="https://territorial.io">territorial.io</a> and as a result I inherited a lot of bad coding practices.<br>
              I created algorithms that would theoretically dominate in matches, and <abbr title="The frenchies"><span id="aUnderlineTooltip2">some people</span></abbr> tried to frame me for cheating
              <br>PLOT TWIST: they backfired, and now I write updates for the game from time to time xD. <br><br>
              I am also working on my own game called <b>Evoku</b>. Basically sudoku but evolved with multiplayer and powerups.
              Let's see how good that goes <img id="aEmoji3" src="https://teinc3.github.io/assets/shining_blob.gif" alt="Shining_Blob">
              <br><br>
              Oh, and I'm also updating this website. Later I'll add a sidebar for custom single-page navigation.
            </li>
